# ðŸ§  Mini Machine Learning Projects in Healthcare

This repository contains a collection of small-scale machine learning projects focused on healthcare applications. Each project is designed to demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques in medical contexts, providing practical examples for learning and development.

## Project Overview

### 1. Breast Cancer Detection
- **Objective**: Develop a model to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on clinical features.
- **Dataset**: [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, feature selection, model training with algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 2. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) Calculator
- **Objective**: Implement a tool to identify early signs of SIRS in patients using vital signs and laboratory data.
- **Dataset**: Simulated patient data reflecting vital signs and lab results.
- **Techniques**: Rule-based system implementation, threshold analysis, alert generation for early detection.

### 3. Hospital Attendance Prediction with Neural Networks
- **Objective**: Predict patient attendance for scheduled hospital appointments using historical data.
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle's Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
- **Techniques**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, neural network model development using TensorFlow/Keras, performance evaluation with metrics like precision and recall.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow, Keras
- matplotlib, seaborn
